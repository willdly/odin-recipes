    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 pounds beef soup bones</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, quartered</li>
        <li>1 (4 inch) piece fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>2 pounds beef oxtail</li>
        <li>1 white (daikon) radish, sliced</li>
        <li>2 ounces whole star anise pods</li>
        <li>1/2 (3 inch) cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>2 whole cloves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black peppercorns</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds dried flat rice noodles</li>
        <li>1/2 pound frozen beef sirloin</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the beef bones in a 9-quart (or larger) pot. Season with salt, and fill pot with 2 gallons of water.
        Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat broiler. Put onions and unpeeled ginger on a foil-lined, 10x15-inch roasting pan. 
            Broil 4 to 5 inches from heat until onion and ginger are charred, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool slightly. 
            Chop onions. Peel and slice ginger.</li>
        <li>Skim fat from surface of broth, and add oxtail, daikon, and charred onions. Tie anise, cinnamon stick, 
            cloves, peppercorns and charred ginger in a square of cheesecloth; add to broth. Stir in sugar, fish sauce, 
            and remaining 2 tsp. salt. Simmer over medium-low heat at least 4 hours (the longer, the better). Strain 
            broth. Discard spices and bones. Reserve meat from bones for other uses, if desired. Taste broth and add 
            additional salt as needed. Chill overnight.</li>
        <li>Skim fat from top of chilled broth. Bring broth to a boil; reduce heat and keep hot until ready to serve.</li>
        <li>Cook rice noodles in boiling water according to package directions until soft, but not mushy. Cut sirloin 
            into paper-thin slices. </li>
        <li>Divide noodles among bowls (1 1/2 cups per bowl). Top each with a few raw sirloin slices. Ladle boiling 
            broth into bowls to cook beef and cover noodles.</li>
    </ol>
